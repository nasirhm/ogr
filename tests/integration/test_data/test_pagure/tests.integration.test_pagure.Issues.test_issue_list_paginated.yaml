                              by pygit2 itself. It doesn't always happen, so re-running
                              it usually causes it to clear up.

                            \n\r\nWould it be useful to allow Pagure to sync changes\
                            \ between multiple issue repos? Issues repos might push\
                            \ and pull from one another in a heirarchical or cyclic\
                            \ graph, with any of those repos being a source of new\
                            \ information.\r\n\r\nOne type of potential issue is if\
                            \ repo B is a clone of repo A, and both share the same\
                            \ issue 1, but both create different issues 2 before a\
                            \ sync between both repos is attempted. The repo B pulls\
                            \ issue 2 from repo A, and renames issue 2 as 3. Would\
                            \ future changes and syncs between both issue repos require\
                            \ merge conflict resolution? How would consistency remain\
                            \ up to date on both repos?\r\n\r\nDisplaying different\
                            \ issue numbers for the same issue on different repos\
                            \ could be confusing. If a comment in issue 1 refers to\
                            \ issue 2 on repo A, but issue 2 is issue 3 on repo B,\
                            \ the comment would reference the wrong issue on repo\
                            \ B.\r\n\r\nAnother possible consistency issue could come\
                            \ up if comments are made on two different issue repos\
                            \ before they are synced after the fact.\r\n\r\nIt's possible\
                            \ that this is already taken care of, but I thought that\
                            \ I would bring it up!\r\n\r\nThanks! : )\r\n"

                              and assumes a specific tag convention. But the way the
                              underlying generator works, you _can_ get correctly
                              structured tarballs. This little feature is mostly designed
                              to deal with Java and GNOME packages that use sometimes-insane
                              tagging conventions (mostly CVS/SVN style tags for monorepos).

                              you, then go for that.

                              push it, not that I've actually pushed it.) I don't
                              think I'd ever have learned that, on my own.

                              ships with the pagure auth enabled by default, but that
                              still requires the user to manually edit `sshd_config`
                              and add the custom `AuthorizedKeysCommand` entry there.  It'd
                              be great if we could just flip a switch in `pagure.cfg`,
                              restart things and have everything work OOTB.

                              We already do that with other software we run.

                              probably permanently switch the shebangs to `python3`
                              variants. This is pretty much only a thing for supporting
                              Python 2 or Python 3.

                            \n- GitLab and GitHub both don't have very fine-grained\
                            \ access controls, so we're forced to ask for more access\
                            \ than we actually need.\r\n- For GitLab, we have to have\
                            \ SourceHut administration register an account with the\
                            \ GitLab instance and set up an OAuth client manually\

                              \ and the build system imposes what the `Release` value\

                              anything, an implicit action that does it inside the
                              PR before the merge and allows reviewing the changes
                              before merging makes better sense to me.

                            useful to have a link to the commit modifying the file
                            right above the file view, like how it's done on GitHub
                            and GitLab. This makes it easier to go straight from a
                            file to looking at the full context via clicking on the
                            commit associated with the version of the file being viewed.

                              We should just include the diff when is shorter than
                              TBD lines and show a note / allow loading them async
                              when the diff is larger than that

                              name: fbo
                          content: "Today to validate a webhook payload a system needs\
                            \ to know the project's private token. The connector endpoint\
                            \ (that allow to read the webhook token) has been added\
                            \ recently but it requires the modify project ACL right\
                            \ and being a project admin. So a third party application\
                            \ will need admin access in order to read the token then\
                            \ validate and handle the payload.\r\n\r\nObviously, the\
                            \ token could be shared manually with the third party\
                            \ app operator, but if the application manages multiple\
                            \ projects then it is problematic.\r\n\r\nSo my idea is\
                            \ to create a new endpoint to read the webhook token for\
                            \ a given project but make it accessible to a project\
                            \ collaborator starting with the ticket access level.\r\
                            \nAs a project admin, to interact with a third party application,\
                            \ he will need to add third party app user as collaborator\
                            \ and set the webhook server url.\r\n\r\nFor instance\
                            \ on Github and Gitlab, the token is free form and one\
                            \ can be specified by webhook url. In the third party\
                            \ application configuration it is then possible to stick\
                            \ to an unique token, then tell project owners to use\
                            \ that given token. It seems this kind of integration\
                            \ is a bit flawed as someone that know that unique token\
                            \ could forge events for other projects. (Regarding a\
                            \ zuul third party app, projects to handle are defined\
                            \ in the zuul configuration so potential issues are mitigated).\r\
                            \n\r\nOn github, applications can be defined. So a third\
                            \ party application could interact with github repositories\
                            \ through the github application. When a github application\
                            \ is created the application owner get a webhook_token\
                            \ an app_id and an app_key. These token, id and key will\
                            \ be used by the third party application to interact with\
                            \ repositories/organisations that have added the github\
                            \ application. So here we see that if a project/organisation\
                            \ owner authorize a github app in its project/organisation\
                            \ then the third party application can easily validate\
                            \ the hook payload via the webhook_token.\r\n\r\nWhat\
                            \ do you think ? how could we manage to let third party\
                            \ applications deal more easily with payload validation\
                            \ ?"

                              \ that the task system doesn't provide any information\
                              \ as to the state of the task. We're still using redis\

                            \ if the repository is bigger (400 MiB - https://pagure.io/archlinux-packages),\
                            \ it is expected that the forking will take longer. And\
                            \ indeed, it does.\r\n\r\nCurrently Pagure automatically\
                            \ shows its \"sorry for inconvenience\" message (\"This\

                            \ to \"slow celery queue\" by default so maybe have a\
                            \ different threshold for such \"slow\" tasks and different\
                            \ threshold for normal, quick tasks?\r\n\r\nWDYT?"

                              \ that it is non-free, so it should either be removed\

                              \ all this before, and came to the conclusion that Pagure\
                              \ on Debian would be able to use `libjs-highlight.js`.\
                              \  I think the only reason I created this bug is to\
                              \ let you guys know that upstream Pagure has this issue.\r\

                              still the initial request makes sense to me.

                              \ fields, which seems far too granular to be useful\
                              \ to anyone other than the developers.) What audience\
                              \ is that even for, that filtering by tags would be\
                              \ given a higher priority than a general text search?\r\
                              \n\r\nIt's also not as useful a search as it could be.\
                              \ For instance, searching for my username in this repo\
                              \ turns up 0 results. It's only by _filtering_ for my\
                              \ username under \"Submitted by\", that my previous\
                              \ issues can be located. (If there are others I've commented\
                              \ on, before this one \u2014 I'm _pretty_ sure there\
                              \ are, but who can remember? \u2014 there is apparently\
                              \ no way to locate those at all.)\r\n\r\nFiltering options\
                              \ are fine, but they're usually applied _after_ searching,\
                              \ if too many results make the search unwieldy. But\
                              \ search should be able to match the contents of **_all_**\
                              \ of the filterable fields, in addition to text content."

                            \ may be minutes or hours later).\r\n2. There's no notification\
                            \ emitted on the completion of the CI run, so a new contributor\
                            \ will have no reason at all to think that they might\
                            \ need to go and manually check the results.\r\n\r\nFor\
                            \ example: https://pagure.io/releng/fedora-module-defaults/pull-request/123\r\
                            \n\r\nI have CI that verifies that the YAML documents\
                            \ being modified meet Fedora policies. As the reviewer,\
                            \ *I* know that I need to check the CI results, but this\
                            \ leads to a much longer round-trip time since I have\
                            \ to add a comment informing the contributor that their\
                            \ submission didn't pass the tests."

                          content: "Today the PR vote system in Pagure is that anyone\
                            \ can add a :thumbsup: that will enable the merge button\
                            \ when the score threshold (defined in the setting) is\
                            \ reached. That's ok when an human, usually the project\
                            \ admins will click the merge button.\r\n\r\nIn the case\
                            \ where a bot acts as the gating system we might want\
                            \ to add another level of safety when computing the PR\
                            \ score to avoid the situation where the bot could merge\
                            \ a change w/o any review from main project maintainers.\r\
                            \n\r\nThe idea I want to propose is, in the project settings,\
                            \ add a group selector along with the \"minimal score\
                            \ to merge a PR\" field. Then the score computation will\
                            \ only consider :thumbsup:  from the users from the selected\
                            \ group. For instance only the 'pagure-maintainers' group\
                            \ users will have their :thumbsup: took in account. We\

                              You can subscribe to issues, but can't list issues subscribed
                              to by a user, you can only list issues opened by or
                              assigned to a specific user.

                            starred it's not practical to unstar/restar to achieve
                            a preferred order.

                              \ more. \r\n\r\nThe question I think that needs to be\
                              \ studied is: Is supporting time-bounded issue graphs\
                              \ important?\r\n\r\nWe have child and parents references\
                              \ between issues, creating a issue graph. From my understanding\
                              \ we support circular references, i.e. an issue can\
                              \ both block and depend on a secondary issue.\r\n\r\n\
                              Why should we support time-bounded issue graphs?\r\n\
                              \r\nIf a issue is marked with a time-bound then all\
                              \ the children issues will be \"implicitly\" marked\
                              \ as due before that date.  The parent issue must not\
                              \ be dew before that date.\r\n\r\nThis would help development\
                              \ work flows.  If you add a issue to a milestone; however\
                              \ that issue has a longer dew date; a error should be\
                              \ displayed.  If you add a child issue to a issue, and\
                              \ the child has a longer dew date, likewise an error\
                              \ should be displayed."

                              to introduce a new API endpoint `user/assigned` which
                              could be used to query all issues/pull requests assigned
                              to given user? Or what best way would you recommend
                              to get the list of assigned issues/pull requests closed
                              in given timeframe?

                          - comment: Good news everyone. Niels has agreed to waive/remove
                              the "advertising" clause in this code. I've pushed this
                              change upstream in a Pull Request to python-bcrypt.
                              His permission to relicense resolves this concern for
                              pagure immediately, though, once this change lands upstream,
                              pagure should use the newer python-bcrypt code so that
                              others who see this will not be confused.

                            \ \"bcrypt\" is a hard dependency for pagure. However\
                            \ bcrypt is licensed under \"ASL 2.0 and ISC and BSD and\
                            \ BSD with advertising\". The most important licenses\
                            \ here are are \"ASL 2.0\" and \"BSD with advertising\"\
                            .\r\n\r\nThe \"ASL 2.0\" requirement could be satisfied\
                            \ by using pagure effectively under \"GPLv3+\" (and I\
                            \ think the project should do this as there is no way\
                            \ using pagure in an GPLv2 mode.\r\n\r\nThe more consequential\
                            \ thing is \"BSD with advertising\" though. bcrypt 3.0\
                            \ added a [blowfish implementation from OpenBSD](https://github.com/pyca/bcrypt/commit/394882d070390f25caeebb5fa27b73bc7666c7e4#diff-e15af2003c8e7aa298ab4a92ea70b332)\

                          content: "I'm looking at the idea of implementing native\
                            \ support for Pagure's webhooks in OpenShift as Fedora\
                            \ continues to adopt OpenShift for applications in its\
                            \ infrastructure.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a couple of\
                            \ deficiencies with our existing webhook format:\r\n\r\
                            \n- We cannot tell what type of webhook it is from the\
                            \ header (no `X-Pagure-Webhook-Event`) which makes filtering\
                            \ events very expensive\r\n- We do not have some basic\
                            \ information about commits included in any event that\
                            \ includes commit info (such as author, committer, author\
                            \ and commit date, and commit message)\r\n\r\nThe overall\
                            \ issue is that our webhook format is not even specified.\
                            \ It's instead part of the fedmsg documentation, which\
                            \ is rather problematic since it means we're dependent\
                            \ on fedmsg formatting for webhooks.\r\n\r\nWe should\
                            \ extend our webhooks to provide detail [similar to what\
                            \ GitHub offers](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/)\
                            \ or [similar to what GitLab offers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html).\r\
                            \n\r\nWe don't _necessarily_ have to have the same format,\
                            \ but being broadly compatible in content with GitHub\
                            \ is useful so that if a GitHub API shim would be desired,\
                            \ it could be easily done."

                            \ those with ACLs or require login to view\r\n\r\n# Background\r\
                            \n\r\nCurrently, tickets set to private are only viewable\
                            \ by those with the correct ACLs. You must be a member\
                            \ of the repo with privileges to view private issues.\r\
                            \n\r\nOne gain from this is with search engine indexing.\
                            \ Sometimes a ticket's discussion or comments may be sensitive\
                            \ in nature or contain content that could be damaging\
                            \ for an individual. In those tickets, making them private\
                            \ might be preferred but it locks anyone without the ACLs\
                            \ out from the conversation. This feature would be a hybrid\
                            \ approach, to allow participation from the wider community\
                            \ without search engines or a casual visitor from seeing\
                            \ these tickets.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nOne way to implement\
                            \ this is as a project setting, where an admin can allow\
                            \ for issues to be filed as private or require login.\r\
                            \n\r\n## Default behavior\r\n\r\nIf this feature is added,\
                            \ I envision this default behavior:\r\n\r\n* Option for\

                            \ (keeps things simple for the average project admin)\r\
                            \n* User with ticket ACLs always has ability to change\
                            \ a ticket to private or require authentication (even\
                            \ if setting is disabled)\r\n\r\n## When enabled\r\n\r\
                            \nIf the option is enabled in repo settings, it would\
                            \ change the following:\r\n\r\n* User filing a ticket\
                            \ has two optional, mutually exclusive options to choose\
                            \ on creating issue: _Private to admins_ (already implemented)\
                            \ and _Private to logged-in users_.\r\n\r\nOr something\
                            \ to this effect.\r\n\r\n# Outcome\r\n\r\n* More flexibility\
                            \ for private tickets with different levels of privacy\r\
                            \n* Avoids search engines indexing certain content that\
                            \ is not valuable to the public, but might be valuable\

                            \ PR description or comment, its horizontal width is limited\
                            \ just as 'regular' text blocks are. See this screenshot:\r\
                            \n\r\n![Pagure issue with chopped-off code blocks](https://www.happyassassin.net/blog/pagure-narrow-code.png)\r\
                            \n\r\nThis doesn't make any sense. The width of regular\
                            \ text blocks is limited because they are automatically\
                            \ wrapped, and it's easier for human eyes to read wrapped\
                            \ text if it's not too wide. But code blocks are not wrapped,\
                            \ obviously. The point of a code block is that the exact\
                            \ original formatting is preserved. So if there's a wide\
                            \ line in a code block, you wind up with a narrow code\
                            \ block with a long horizontal scroll bar...and now you\
                            \ both have to read a wide line, *and* do it with a narrow\
                            \ view window. That's the worst of all possible worlds.\r\
                            \n\r\nCode blocks should be allowed to be as wide as they\
                            \ can be given the page layout."

                            source code files) is not that helpful and can be a tad
                            unintuitive sometimes as you can see in this [example](https://pagure.io/Ambassade/blob/0ebc5b3769e50c3463bdc39af0160c7db0d3f00b/f/src/parser.rs#_14)
                            (line 14). I think better syntax highlighting for Rust
                            files would be a good new feature for Pagure.

                              \ and easily noticed, if a project maintainer takes\

                              \ pull requests for these repositories. I prefer to\
                              \ place them in the sources repo so they are visible\
                              \ and accessible for someone browsing through the project."

                            \ has a different way of doing things or has their own\
                            \ preferences. Documenting these things are helpful for\
                            \ new contributors. A project can write their own contributing\
                            \ guidelines in a Markdown file today, but it's on the\
                            \ maintainer to make them more visible and for the user\
                            \ to go and find them.\r\n\r\nMaking contributing guidelines\
                            \ more visible in the UI encourages maintainers to write\
                            \ them (because there is a higher chance they will be\
                            \ seen) and also reduces the burden on maintainers if\
                            \ they write good guidelines for new contributors to follow.\r\
                            \n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nI like GitHub's implementation.\
                            \ If you place a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root directory\
                            \ or in a `.github` folder, this is a special path and\
                            \ the UI will offer suggestions in different places (e.g.\
                            \ filing a new issue or opening a pull request prompts\
                            \ you, \"Did you already see the contributing guidelines?\"\
                            ). I would like to see something similar, except maybe\
                            \ a more platform-neutral vocabulary if I wanted to put\
                            \ it in a hidden directory.\r\n\r\nSupporting UI for this\
                            \ is key. I think adding prompts in the following places\
                            \ is a good idea, if a project adds contributing guidelines:\r\
                            \n\r\n1. On _Issues_ page\r\n2. On _Pull Requests_ page\r\
                            \n3. When opening a new issue\r\n4. When opening a new\
                            \ PR\r\n\r\n# Outcome\r\n\r\n1. Easier for project maintainers\
                            \ to communicate their workflow / preferences to new contributors\r\
                            \n2. More likely a new contributor will actually notice\
                            \ the guidelines written"

                            \ page). I think a maximum of eight emojis per project\
                            \ seems reasonable.\r\n\r\n# Outcome\r\n\r\n1. More flexibility\
                            \ to use emoji reactions for different purposes\r\n2.\

                              \ the private ticket context, multiple assignees are\
                              \ still helpful for me as a maintainer, e.g. when two\
                              \ or more people are working on an issue simultaneously.\r\
                              \n\r\nAn example could be a new contributor working\
                              \ on a task and a mentor assigned to help the new contributor\
                              \ and review their changes."

                              \n \r\n@jflory7 , It's   possible that @pingou is not\
                              \ aware that the current access model does not allow\
                              \ users (ie consumers of the artifact) to assign tags.\
                              \ It seems that Pagure uses tags to describe the **content**\
                              \ of the issue and also to indicate the **status**.\r\
                              \n\r\nSomeone who is **not** a project member and wants\
                              \ to provide feedback or suggestions:\r\n\r\n* Doesn't\
                              \ know what info you would like them to provide.\r\n\
                              * Doesn't know where they can review the history of\
                              \ similar issues.\r\n* Has no way of knowing which tags\
                              \ to use\r\n* Doesn't know how to interpret the tags\r\
                              \n* Can't add any tags anyway, because they don't have\
                              \ the privs.\r\n\r\n> I would be glad to add something\
                              \ in the doc explaining this, suggestion on how/where\
                              \ to do it is welcome :)\r\n\r\nOK, I'm reluctant to\
                              \ provide  an example because I spent 40 minutes composing\
                              \ the previous example and you missed the point because\
                              \ you didn't like the implementation.\r\nI would suggest\
                              \ instead that you consider what answers you would provide\
                              \ to these questions:\r\n\r\n* If someone outside the\
                              \ developer team uses Pagure, do I care?\r\n* If someone\
                              \ has a suggestion, do I care?\r\n* If someone outside\
                              \ the team wants to help, where should they start?\r\
                              \n* If someone is using Pagure and finds a problem,\
                              \ what info would I like them to provide?\r\n\r\n-Blaise"

                            in a Pagure issue, but not the original comment. An option
                            to add a reaction to the original comment is helpful instead
                            of replying with a +1 in a comment. Sometimes I want to
                            add a "like" to a ticket that is helpful or interesting
                            for me, but I don't want add a distracting comment if
                            there is development discussion going on.

                          - comment: I see the fix include a rebase button on the
                              UI (I like it !, for instance on Gerrit I use it a lot,
                              and I think it missed from Github) Nice that Pagure
                              will have one :) Also but I'm not sure do you mean the
                              change will make the cached_merge_status more accurate
                              ?

                              \ deeper. The weird thing was that I was able to create\
                              \ repositories through the gitolite-admin repository\
                              \ itself and then clone them.\r\n\r\nSo I created one\
                              \ repository with the gitolite-admin and one with pagure\
                              \ and checked the hooks. What I saw was that gitolite\
                              \ added an extra '/' in the symbolic link to the update\
                              \ script. I deleted the symbolic link from the repository\
                              \ created by pagure and created a new symbolic link\
                              \ with the extra '/' in it. And it just works!\r\n\r\
                              \nFor example, Pagure creates in `/srv/git/repositories/testing.git/hooks/`:\r\
                              \n~~~~\r\nupdate -> /srv/git/.gitolite/hooks/common/update\r\
                              \n~~~~\r\nGitolite create:\r\n~~~~\r\nupdate -> /srv/git//.gitolite/hooks/common/update\
                              \  (mind the extra '/' after /srv/git/)\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\

                              \ framework being familiar with it will help you. I\
                              \ recommend reading the following [tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)\
                              \ for that.\r\n\r\nThe source code is available [here](https://pagure.io/pagure/blob/master/f/pagure)\
                              \ and it is a good idea to look at the [tests](https://pagure.io/pagure/blob/master/f/tests)\
                              \ to understand how things are working\r\n\r\nHope that\

                              \ or less):\r\n\r\n- the [ui](https://pagure.io/pagure/blob/master/f/pagure/ui)\
                              \ which is the part responsible what the interface most\
                              \ people interact with pagure with.\r\n- the [api](https://pagure.io/pagure/blob/master/f/pagure/api)\
                              \ which is responsible for the API of pagure\r\n- the\
                              \ [lib](https://pagure.io/pagure/blob/master/f/pagure/lib)\
                              \ which contains all the code related to the database\
                              \ model (see [model.py](https://pagure.io/pagure/blob/master/f/pagure/lib/model.py)),\

                              \ and in general all the logic that is not specific\
                              \ to the web-framework and may be used both in the UI\
                              \ and API (most of this logic will be found in [query.py](https://pagure.io/pagure/blob/master/f/pagure/lib/query.py))\r\
                              \n\r\nAfter that:\r\n- the ``static`` folder contains\
                              \ all the \"static\" files, (JS, image, CSS files) served/used\
                              \ in the web UI\r\n- the ``templates`` folder contains\
                              \ the html templates used to build the web UI\r\n- the\
                              \ ``themes`` folder contains the html template, static\
                              \ files and definitions for the different themes of\
                              \ pagure\r\n- the ``cli`` folder contains the code for\
                              \ the ``pagure-admin`` command-line utility\r\n- the\
                              \ ``hooks`` folder contains the files and code related\
                              \ to the different git hook one can enable on a pagure\
                              \ project\r\nthe ``internal`` folder contains the code\
                              \ for the internal API endpoints, to be used only by\
                              \ the UI or potentially tools running on the server\
                              \ (ie they are not for public consumption).\r\n\r\n\
                              Hoping this helps :)\r\n\r\nI think we may want to document\
                              \ this in our doc as well, thanks for the suggestion\
                              \ :)"

                              \n\r\n1. (at least according to the api docs), the pagination\
                              \ data returned appears to be a little inconsistent.\
                              \ pagination field vs specific pagination_* fields (e.g.\
                              \ pagination_issues_assigned), or other variations (like\
                              \ repo_pagination).\r\n2. sometimes the parameters themselves\
                              \ vary (repopage, forkpage)\r\n3. difficulty merging\
                              \ the results in general. the field containing the primary\
                              \ result varies, or is sometimes split (e.g. issues_assigned,\
                              \ issues_created)\r\n4. general slowness. I guess each\
                              \ call is a duplicate query, right?\r\n5. (potentially)\
                              \ the pagination stability issue\r\n"

                              system will set up the URLs can pretty easily predict
                              and type it out if they want to, but it's more trouble
                              than it's worth to change this behavior since it confuses
                              people if the URL is available but doesn't work.

                              think maybe a solution that would work for everyone
                              would be displaying the URL, but making it clear that
                              it's not available for pushing yet, e.g. use a red background
                              for the input box and show a tooltip when user does
                              mouseover?

                            \ text around it.\r\n\r\n *  I can upload several images,\

                            \ would become obvious if I uploaded 2 images: I would\
                            \ not even be able to discern one from another.)\r\n\r\
                            \nSo I thought, \"well, image attachements are broken\"\
                            , so I decided to upload the image to my own VPS and link\
                            \ it.  I went with that (ie. `scp`, `rm`), and eventually\
                            \ I finished polishing the text and was ready to hit Submit.\r\
                            \n\r\nBUT, turns out that this failed with some browser\
                            \ error indicating that the file is missing.  I figured\
                            \ out that the browser wanted to upload the image on Submit,\
                            \ **despite** the fact that I deleted the `<!!image>`\
                            \ tag (I assumed that's the only control I had over the\
                            \ attachment).  This of course could not succeed because\
                            \ I already deleted it.\r\n\r\nSadly this error was an\
                            \ \"error page\", covering the whole view page, so all\
                            \ I could do was hit Back and .... I was back to the Issues\
                            \ list, ans the text of the issue was lost.  (Luckily\
                            \ I still had it in clipboard.)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nNow,\
                            \ I understand from Pagure POV, dealing safely with image\
                            \ uploads is not easy, but if only way is to have user\
                            \ to go through this hassle, then well, ok, but it should\
                            \ be obvious from the UI that this is needed.  Also user\
                            \ should have control of the attachments' placement within\
                            \ the text, and of their being uploaded---before clicking\
                            \ Create Issue."

                              make sense to make the reply action more obvious. A

                              way.

                              so that they're rendered natively. Or alternatively,
                              embed the image that's used from the emoji font we use
                              now.

                          - comment: This is a bug in the import from git process,
                              but to fix it we may have to change a little the structure
                              of the JSON as I'm not sure we have the "type" of the
                              custom field stored anywhere atm.

                              \ since the content is being sent in a different format,\
                              \ there's also an argument for conforming it to that\
                              \ format.\r\n\r\nWhen \"what the user posts\" contains\
                              \ HTML comments, those will _only_ be visible in the\
                              \ email \u2014 they won't be visible to anyone viewing\
                              \ the post on the web. That's sort of the entire point\
                              \ of using HTML comments to provide instructional notes\
                              \ in the pre-filled text: to keep that text out of the\
                              \ visible content, even if the user leaves it in.\r\n\
                              \r\nSo, stripping those HTML comments out of the emailed\
                              \ copy, so that it matches the content visible on the\
                              \ web \u2014 rather than putting the onus on the poster\
                              \ to remove them \u2014 would seem to follow the principle\
                              \ of least surprise. That's my take, anyway."

                            \ is that a lot of parts are interconnected in a way that\
                            \ makes it very hard to decouple them and run them as\
                            \ separate services/pods. Even though this will be major\
                            \ effort, we should put some work in this. Specifically,\
                            \ these points would be great to have fixed:\r\n\r\nIt'd\
                            \ be ideal if the git hooks didn't import pagure directly,\
                            \ but rather use (newly created) API endpoints. This way,\
                            \ the sshd service could be just a simple sshd and wouldn't\
                            \ have to carry all Pagure dependencies (this would also\
                            \ mean we'd be able to have a separate image for it, which\
                            \ we could upgrade separately).\r\n\r\nAnother problem\
                            \ that we have right now is that we have 3 kinds of services\
                            \ that need to see the disk volume with repositories -\
                            \ server, workers and sshd. In microservices world, there'd\
                            \ ideally be just one microservice actually touching the\
                            \ data and the rest would be using its API ([1]). This\
                            \ would probably require a huge effort, but we should\
                            \ at least try to see if it's possible for some of the\
                            \ services.\r\n\r\n[1] Our problems with this made us\
                            \ run all these services on the same physical node in\
                            \ UpShift, which is problematic - if the node fails, we\
                            \ don't have a deployment. The reason we need to run them\
                            \ on the same node is that these services immediately\
                            \ use data written by each other - if running on different\
                            \ nodes, NFS doesn't sync fast enough which results in\
                            \ all kinds of different failures.\r\n  (Bohuslav Kabrda)"

                          - comment: "@pingou The problem with this is that not having\
                              \ service accounts is a problem when people's accounts\
                              \ are terminated, even though the service is maintained\
                              \ separately. It also means it's harder to identify\
                              \ whether it is a bot verses a regular user.\r\n\r\n\
                              For example, at my workplace, using regular users for\
                              \ this became a problem when those people left the company\
                              \ and their accounts were globally disabled.\r\n\r\n\
                              Having service/bot accounts means we can create specific\
                              \ users that are used for interacting with Pagure irrespective\
                              \ of the login mechanism (that is, if local is not the\
                              \ auth mechanism, then you can _still_ create \"local\"\
                              \ accounts for services/bots)."

                              \n\r\nThe problem with accountability could (and *should*)\
                              \ be solved by assigning people/groups as maintainers\
                              \ of the bot (there shouldn't be a bot without maintainers).\r\
                              \n\r\nAnother advantage of having a bot (on top of what\
                              \ @ngompa said) is that you can easily distinguish actions\
                              \ done by the bot and by the actual user who owns the\
                              \ bot - you don't have that kind of distinction if you\
                              \ just use API tokens and deploy keys, because everything\
                              \ is \"done by the user\". So if the bot gets broken,\
                              \ you can isolate actions done by the service account\
                              \ and reverse them while keeping the owner's actions\
                              \ intact.\r\n\r\nI think basically we need a way to:\r\
                              \n\r\n* create, edit and delete a bot account (I think\
                              \ we don't need to do this via UI initially, we can\
                              \ just do this via API)\r\n* add an attribute to the\
                              \ `User` class that specifies whether or not this account\
                              \ is a bot\r\n* create and revoke API keys for the bot\
                              \ (again, just API is fine)\r\n* add and remove SSH\
                              \ keys for the bot"

                              \ sense to have bots in the standard users table with\

                              \ name and enforce that every bot has name ``bot:actualname``\
                              \ (or something similar). This would also give a clear\
                              \ visual indication to users on e.g. what account is\

                              We would need a new output type for this, but maintaining
                              a list of file suffixes for that doesn't scale (btw.
                              .fmf is already used for Fax Man Documents) . I'd suggest
                              switching to raw output for now.

                            \ of the inline comments.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the inline\
                            \ comments are linked to the line number of the patch\
                            \ that is generated for a PR, while the new diff view\

                            \ so that is ***item one***\r\n\r\nThe second thing we\
                            \ can fix here is providing a little more context in the\
                            \ comment stream itself for inline comments. Maybe a few\
                            \ lines above and below for each inline comment. This\
                            \ will help also if the commit(s) in the PR have changed.\
                            \ We might also want to investigate if we can inform the\

                            \ really apply to a line anymore.\r\n\r\nFinally, in covering\
                            \ the above two items, we need to make sure somehow that\
                            \ older inline comments still work. we might need to fall\
                            \ back to the old view if there are comments in the old\
                            \ style or something like that."

                          - comment: With specifically the exception of `pagure-ev`,
                              there are no additional requirements for the other stuff,
                              since the rest are celery workers. Technically `pagure-ci`
                              requires `python-jenkins` if being used with Jenkins.
                              Beyond that, there's nothing really needed.

                            Also we could publish that to pypi which would make it
                            easy for people to install plugins.

                              My proposal for where to show what was meant for the
                              page with list of commits for specific branch - there
                              we should show only results that are related for that
                              specific branch. On a page with that specific commit,
                              we should definitely display results for all branches
                              (perhaps in sections).

                          - comment: "So I'm running into a design issue that I'd\
                              \ like to discuss first:\r\n\r\nI added a ``branch =\
                              \ sa.Column(sa.Text(), nullable=True, default=None)``\
                              \ attribute to ``CommitFlag`` - it should be ``None``\
                              \ when related to no branch and a string if related\
                              \ to a specific branch. Now I'm trying to adapt e.g.\
                              \ ``/api/0/<repo>/c/<commit_hash>/flag`` to be able\
                              \ to work with branches. I want to add an optional ``?branch=value``\
                              \ argument, but I'm struggling with what value it should\
                              \ have for these two cases:\r\n\r\n* I want to get all\
                              \ flags regardless of ``branch`` value\r\n* I want to\
                              \ get just flags that are not related to any specific\
                              \ branch\r\n\r\nBasically I guess we could say that\
                              \ for the first case, you must not specify the ``branch``\
                              \ parameter at all, but what do we want to do with the\
                              \ second case? There's no special \"null/None\" value.\
                              \ Do you think this should have a special value to pass\
                              \ to ``branch``?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, a good solution\
                              \ might be returning the flags with ``branch = None``\
                              \ always (e.g. even if ``?branch=foo`` is specified),\
                              \ hence considering them implicitly associated with\
                              \ any branch (this would mean that it wouldn't be possible\
                              \ to get just a list of flags unrelated to specific\
                              \ branch).\r\n\r\nWDYT?"

                              \ including flags not associated with any branches when\
                              \ flags for a branch are requested, I'd actually prefer\
                              \ always returning also branch non-specific flags. My\
                              \ perception is that I'm trying to get all flags that\
                              \ apply to a commit on a certain branch and the branch\
                              \ non-specific ones do apply as well, so I'd default\
                              \ to returning them too."

                          content: "The Pagure deployment that I'm managing contains\
                            \ repos that have lots of branches, e.g. product-X.1,\
                            \ product-X.2, product-X.3 etc; product-X.Y+1 is branched\
                            \ from product-X.Y on creation.\r\n\r\nI have a mechanism\
                            \ that adds CI results to these commits as flags and I\
                            \ came up on a problem. It sometimes happens that developers\
                            \ add a commit with the same hash to multiple branches.\
                            \ This means that CI results coming in for a single commit\
                            \ hash are meant for different product versions. Pagure\
                            \ can't handle this situation right now, so only the latest\
                            \ CI flag from a particular CI system is displayed on\
                            \ every commit in all branches.\r\n\r\nTherefore I'd like\
                            \ to propose adding branch name as an optional attribute\
                            \ of the ``CommitFlag`` object. The logic that displays\
                            \ flags would, for a certain commit:\r\n\r\n* display\
                            \ all flags that have branch name unset\r\n* display all\
                            \ flags that have branch name same as the branch for which\
                            \ we're displaying commits\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to contribute\
                            \ the code that would do this.\r\nI hope this makes sense."

                          - comment: Now that we have the file history view (as of
                              Pagure 5.9), I wonder what would it take to implement
                              history for tickets now? As they are stored as files
                              in a Git repo, could we take advantage of that?

                          - comment: I'll have to dig deeper, but we are currently
                              using flask blueprints to do the themes, and it appears
                              that these can't be changed on a per-user basis. An
                              indidivudal theme however, could use a different CSS
                              on a per-user basis, so that might be do-able, and will
                              totally work for switching a dark and light theme variant
                              for a specific theme.

                              to the code and the tests, it does (cf PR at https://pagure.io/pagure/pull-request/3402
                              which ensures the field gets filled)

                          content: "Pagure CI currently tracks based on \"after-the-fact\"\
                            \ states. That is, all the states are geared around end-goal\
                            \ rather than the progression of the job.\r\n\r\nThis\
                            \ is a bit odd compared to other CI systems, and is somewhat\
                            \ confusing as users expect progression for CI reporting.\r\
                            \n\r\nThe consequence of this model is that one of Pagure\
                            \ CI's supported states is oddly defined:\r\n\r\n* `BUILDING`\
                            \ is defined as `FLAG_PENDING`, and is colored blue (for\
                            \ active)\r\n\r\nAlso, the states supported are incomplete.\
                            \ What I would expect to have for states are the following:\r\
                            \n\r\n* `PENDING` is defined as `FLAG_PENDING` and is\
                            \ colored gray (for not yet started)\r\n* `BUILDING`/`RUNNING`\
                            \ is defined as `FLAG_RUNNING` and is colored blue (for\
                            \ active)\r\n* `SUCCESS` is defined as `FLAG_SUCCESS`\
                            \ and is colored green (for successful completion)\r\n\
                            * `FAILURE` is defined as `FLAG_FAILURE` and is colored\
                            \ red (for failed completion)\r\n* `ABORTED`/`CANCELED`\
                            \ is defined as `FLAG_CANCELED` and is colored black (for\
                            \ user-canceled)\r\n* `SKIPPED` is defined as `FLAG_SKIPPED`\
                            \ and is colored gray (for not being run)\r\n* `SUCCESS_WARN`\
                            \ is defined as `FLAG_SUCCESS_WARN` and is colored orange\
                            \ (for successful completion with allowed failures)\r\n\
                            \r\nJenkins does support all of these states, but it's\
                            \ also critical for reporting with other OSS CI systems,\
                            \ like [Buildbot](https://buildbot.net/), [Concourse CI](https://concourse-ci.org/),\
                            \ [Drone CI](https://drone.io/), and would be useful for\
                            \ even more specific ones like [the simple Koji CI plugin](https://pagure.io/fedora-ci/simple-koji-ci).\r\
                            \n\r\nThe additional states and the focus on progression\
                            \ allows for a richer understanding of what's going on\
                            \ for CI of a particular PR or commit, especially if multiple\
                            \ integrations are in place (though I'm not sure if Pagure\
                            \ supports that yet)."

                              \ should come from the internal implementation of the\
                              \ notification in Pagure, rather than from external\
                              \ user request. Pagure app itself knows which event\
                              \ triggered the notification. And has it all encoded,\
                              \ with certain names(types, classes,.. whatever) and\
                              \ priorities (order of execution).\r\n\r\nSo the header\
                              \ should only expose that information with as little\
                              \ remapping as possible. This way we won't need to keep\

                              \ need to maintain it as a separate entity."

                              \n\r\nIt's quite an unfortunate limitation though (inability\
                              \ to re-use the same deploy key across multiple projects),\
                              \ since Gerrit does not have a way to use a separate\
                              \ SSH key for each project when it does replication.\r\
                              \n\r\nWould you take an RFE to improve this limitation\
                              \ in Pagure?\r\n\r\nIs it a fundamental limitation of\
                              \ gitolite or just some side-effect of how Pagure is\
                              \ constructing the ACLs? I have to admit I don't understand\
                              \ what you meant about \"unable to detect which user\
                              \ you are\"... The push is effectively coming from *no*\
                              \ user, it's from a deploy key, right? And it must know\
                              \ which *repo* I want to push to... so either the deploy\
                              \ key is allowed or not allowed?\r\n\r\nSorry for my\
                              \ ignorance about how the gitolite stuff works behinds\
                              \ the scenes, maybe those are not sensible questions."

                            \r\nI have a SSH public key with comment \"tomcat@linode166708.beaker-project.org\"\
                            \ which I added as a deploy key with push access in https://pagure.io/rpmdeplint\
                            \ some time ago. This key is used by our team Gerrit instance\
                            \ to replicate commits to Pagure. This *was* working happily\
                            \ (I think) up until recently.\r\n\r\nI wanted to add\
                            \ the same key as a deploy key on two other projects,\
                            \ https://pagure.io/beah and https://pagure.io/beaker\
                            \ .\r\n\r\nWhen I pasted the key into the \"add deploy\
                            \ key\" form for the beah project, it accepted the key.\
                            \ But when I did the same thing for the beaker project\
                            \ it refuses and says: \"Deploy key already exists.\"\r\
                            \n\r\nSo now the deploy key is present on two out of my\
                            \ three projects, but it does not have push access to\
                            \ *any* of the three repos.\r\n\r\nIs Pagure intentionally\
                            \ preventing me from reusing the same deploy key on multiple\
                            \ projects, or is that an accident of how it is stored\
                            \ in the database? And do you have any idea why it would\
                            \ no longer have access even on the project where it was\
                            \ originally added?"

                              I've not been in Cc of the tickets for many years. Which
                              is correct. Only recently in the ticket from 2018-01-12
                              something has added me to that package again.

                              least should ensure the timezone is always specified
                              in the string. It will still always be UTC, though.
                              Localizing it turns out to be quite a bit harder, at
                              least with my frontend dev skills.

                              the whole diff. What do you think about it?

                            \ class, which used to be the only game in town (well,\
                            \ it and its more specific subclasses). As of last month,\
                            \ though, they've [invented an alternative](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/pull/629)\
                            \ called `InlineProcessor`. This is a rather more sane\

                            \ does (like the way it pads out the regex in `self.compiled_re`,\
                            \ for e.g.). It should also perform rather better as it\
                            \ handles matching and substitutions such that the regex\
                            \ isn't required to match the entire string (which is\
                            \ why the padding is no longer done).\r\n\r\nWe might\
                            \ want to look at shifting our inline patterns over to\

                              a security point of view. If you want to perform anything
                              on push or anything, note that you can use webhooks
                              to run code on your own system, and if you give it a
                              Deploy Key, it can even clone (and at your option push).

                              \ to oldest' - top one 'Fedora 28', bottom 'Fedora 12'\
                              \ - then someone added 'Fedora 29', and that's shown\
                              \ up at the bottom of the list. So now it's 28, 27,\
                              \ 26...13, 12, 29. And there's no drag-and-drop so I\
                              \ can't get 29 to the top any other way than clicking\
                              \ the 'up' button next to it like 17 times.\r\n\r\n\
                              There's still nothing to tell you what the Date field\
                              \ is for or what values are accepted - if it's free\
                              \ entry, then have a note or tool tip that *says that*.\r\
                              \n\r\nThere is no explanation of what the checkboxes\
                              \ at the right of the list are for - I'd *guess* they\
                              \ allow you to activate or deactivate the milestone,\
                              \ but there's nothing to tell you this at all. They're\
                              \ just mystery meat."

                            \ It just has name and date fields, and you can order\
                            \ the milestones...but it doesn't provide any indication\
                            \ of what the most logical order is. (So I just spent\
                            \ fifteen minutes ordering our milestones 'earliest to\
                            \ latest', only to save it, go to the UI, and find that\
                            \ 'latest to earliest' makes more sense for the UI).\r\
                            \n\r\nIt also provides no kind of pop-up helper for the\
                            \ date field AFAICS, and no text indication of what format\
                            \ the date should be in. So I've no idea if I should type\
                            \ 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YYYYMMDD' or something else, and if\
                            \ it matters at all.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think having 'latest\
                            \ to earliest' be the best order for the milestones is\
                            \ kinda silly, because it means every time you add a *new*\
                            \ milestone, you have to move it to the top of the list\
                            \ (in the usual case where you're more likely to use a\
                            \ newly-created milestone than an older one). This is\
                            \ going to be a pain in the ass if you have 50 milestones.\
                            \ It's already a pain in the ass with 30, really."

                              \ you delete it. It's different from a timeline you\
                              \ can see as much as you want and come back letter if\
                              \ you want."

                              step of the requester having to merge the reverse PR.

                              drive-through contributions to docs. With the upcoming
                              change,  perhaps this request changes to wanting an
                              option to delete the fork immediately when submitting
                              the PR. (And this should be the default when creating
                              a PR with the "fork and edit" button on the web interface.)

                              in the first place. :) So they're not entirely unfindable,
                              but it's kind of awkward to have to first find a random
                              project in the namespace and then go back.

                              asking 'pagure' to inject JS to some random third-party

                              \n\r\nThan READMEs only have to be rendered to HTML\

                              \ on the repo homepage. (And convert relative links\
                              \ to absolute links.)"

                              \ fine in a ticket, but the issue I noticed is when\

                              \ in a row\u2026 it makes a ticket longer to scroll\

                              BugURLs as being defined by a URL and a bug ID. In pagure,
                              there is one bug-tracker per project so you would need
                              an url plugin for every pagure project.

                            in merged PRs the first tag that includes the commits
                            from this PR.

                              at all (which currently has to be manually fetched from

                              still feels like something that shouldn't be necessary
                              when we have Kerberos.

                          - comment: I believe the idea would be to add OpenID Connect
                              support rather than kerberos but pagure should be able
                              to support different authentication mechanism/system
                              and if someone wants to work on this I would be willing
                              to make the adjustments if any are needed.

                          content: "fedrepo-req, the new CLI tool for requesting dist-git\
                            \ repos and branches, requires a pagure identification\
                            \ token in order to work.\r\n\r\nThis seems a bit unfortunate\
                            \ to me, especially we recently switched over to Kerberos\
                            \ authentication for other parts of Fedora. I can kinit\
                            \ and then submit builds to koji; it is a little annoying\
                            \ to need an entirely separate authentication token from\
                            \ pagure in order to request packages and branches. The\
                            \ annoyance is then further compounded by the fact that\
                            \ the pagure auth token needs to be renewed every couple\
                            \ of months; it just adds another thing that a packager\
                            \ needs to keep track of.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if it were\
                            \ possible to use kerberos to auth to pagure (or to the\
                            \ pagure API?), it would be extremely convenient.\r\n\r\
                            \n(See also [#84 on fedrepo_req](https://pagure.io/fedrepo_req/issue/84),\

                              considers the master branch at the moment, that is something
                              that should be tuned for dist-git but is low priority.

                            on epel7 branch (from today). Given work on EPEL is an
                            activity (otherwise this would be kind of discriminating
                            related to activities for Fedora), this should be displayed
                            properly.

                              \ are multiple fixes possible here but generally the\
                              \ block element needs to go.  You could set `display:\
                              \ inline;` onto the `<pre>`.  Or you could change the\
                              \ `<pre>` to a `<span>` and set a monospace font with\
                              \ CSS, as well as a pre-like `white-space` property.\r\
                              \n\r\nIt may also be necessary to include a `<td>` for\
                              \ empty rows, which is not currently done."

                              inline;` to `<pre>` isn''t enough to change the behavior
                              in Firefox.  So the best path is probably to switch
                              to `<span>` with `font-family: monospace` and `white-space:
                              pre` (or `pre-wrap`).'

                          - comment: I don't think using span is a good solution.
                              pre is semantically correct. \<pre\>\<code\> even better.
                              I can dig around and see if the is another solution.

                              https://pagure.io/pagure/pull-request/2568 is weird
                              .... Also, since this was reported in context of PkgDb
                              migration, I think that PkgDb won't leave you as "co-maintainer".

                            \ this is intentional. I expect there are folks using\
                            \ non-master public branches for development (e.g. a devel\

                            \ should be clarified in the docs."

                              \ Che/codenvy.com is all about.\r\nI personally don't\
                              \ think this should be a part of Pagure, as it is an\
                              \ entirely different and complicated problem, as it\
                              \ drags in a ton of challenges, amongst others:\r\n\
                              - How do you allocate resources? Things that people\
                              \ run still take memory and CPU, and this requires significant\
                              \ resources.\r\n- How do you secure the containers so\
                              \ that users can't break out and do things in other\
                              \ people's containers?\r\n- What software do you put\
                              \ in the containers?\r\n\r\nMy personal suggestion is\
                              \ that if you ever move anywhere with this, you should\
                              \ look at integrating with Eclipse Che/Codenvy and making\
                              \ that available from the UI, since they are entirely\
                              \ in the business of making those decisions.\r\n\r\n\
                              We *could* check if it's possible to integrate with\
                              \ codenvy, and have workspaces spun up there in people's\
                              \ personal accounts or the like. That would make it\
                              \ the users' and codenvy's problem for resources/pricing,\
                              \ and we could offer things like passing credentials\
                              \ through automatically.\r\nThis sounds to me like the\
                              \ most sane idea."

                              \ also why that was my suggestion, since there's a reason\
                              \ it's literally the only thing these providers do and\
                              \ sell.\r\nWe also shouldn't forget the first problem\
                              \ I mentioned: *resources*. Containers aren't free.\
                              \ The programs you run in them still use CPU, they still\
                              \ use memory.\r\nMy main point was that Pagure should\
                              \ not reimplement what these people have been doing.\r\
                              \n\r\n> But the point is to reuse pagure account (that\
                              \ is used to edit files online) for git repository modifications.\r\
                              \n\r\nThe way we'd do this depends on what the provider\
                              \ we integrate with has available.\r\nIf they can generate\
                              \ an SSH key and send us the public key back, we're\
                              \ done.\r\nIf not, we should figure out how to get them\
                              \ to do something like that, as that's probably the\
                              \ most feasible solution."

                              maintained one anytime soon?

                              I am not sure I want pagure to send notifications for
                              these events. I would much rather people opt-in on FMN
                              or so if they are so interested in them

                            \ I click `Files` at the top, navigate to file and highlight\
                            \ a line. That gives me the URL to share and it looks\
                            \ like this: `https://pagure.io/pungi/blob/master/f/pungi/compose.py#_358-384`\r\
                            \n\r\nHowever it points to those lines in whatever happens\
                            \ to be the version of the file on `master` branch, so\
                            \ a commit can easily break the link (make it point to\
                            \ wrong lines).\r\n\r\nIt's possible to navigate to the\
                            \ url with hash instead of branch name, but it's a little\
                            \ more involved. The way I know of is: `Commits`, click\
                            \ the latest one, `tree`, and then navigate to file and\
                            \ line.\r\n\r\nIt would be cool if there was a way to\
                            \ turn the branch in url from branch to hash in an easier\
                            \ way.\r\n\r\nGithub does it with `y` keyboard shortcut,\
                            \ which I think is really undiscoverable. Maybe something\
                            \ like this:\r\n\r\n[![Snimek_z_2017-03-23_12-02-12.png](/pagure/issue/raw/914971c9f658fc36410e0fbc917a828558bb85d23ec501d0ce5e1d46369ec5b9-Snimek_z_2017-03-23_12-02-12.png)](/pagure/issue/raw/914971c9f658fc36410e0fbc917a828558bb85d23ec501d0ce5e1d46369ec5b9-Snimek_z_2017-03-23_12-02-12.png)\r\

                            my browser or scrolling.

                              down the issues, etc. and makes it read-only and pulls
                              it out of searches, etc.?  I am putting this here because
                              most of the rename needs I have are to relocate a repo
                              for archive reasons.

                            typing a new one somewhere else, the new comment will
                            be deleted when the first one finishes submission. This
                            causes data loss, but it also slows me down when I have
                            to wait for the first form to finish.

                          content: I've already started to use roadmap to organize
                            issues. After create several roadmap and add a few issues
                            to each roadmap, I found I cannot see roadmap information
                            in project's ``/issues/`` page. It would be nice to display
                            each issue's roadmap in the list so that everyone can
                            easily know which issues are planned to be fixed in which
                            version in the roadmap. This could be also much convenient
                            for maintainers, at least for me, to manage issues without
                            switch between roadmap page and issues page back and forth.

                              \n\r\nIt switches `container` to `container-fluid` (on\
                              \ the wiki, too), moves the badges back onto the line\
                              \ with the text, eliminates extra padding, and adds\
                              \ `lg` and `xl` layouts (because `md` is for windows\
                              \ up to 768px wide).  Though don't really like boostrap's\

                            \ a very large amount of whitespace.  This is fine, I\
                            \ guess, but it does make it really difficult to look\
                            \ at a large amount of information without scrolling endlessly.\
                            \  My desktop is 4880 pixels across and is not hidpi;\
                            \ most of the pagure interface is squeezed into a narrow\
                            \ strip in the middle of the window.\r\n\r\nAfter migrating\
                            \ from trac I find that especially the issues page suffers\
                            \ terribly from having far more whitespace than actual\
                            \ content and I started playing with the styling and greasemonkey\
                            \ to get something which I find usable. \r\n\r\nThe first\
                            \ thing I did was:\r\n```\r\n$('.container').addClass('container-fluid').removeClass('container')\r\
                            \n```\r\n\r\nFluid containers will occupy the screen width\
                            \ but otherwise seem to be identically responsive. The\
                            \ fact that isn't the default has always baffled me about\
                            \ bootstrap, but regardless, it really does help pagure\
                            \ in general.  Unfortunately doing it in greasemonkey\
                            \ for all of pagure breaks the comment entry boxes, and\
                            \ I haven't dug into why.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that\
                            \ really helps is\r\n\r\n```\r\n$('#pagure-issues-list\
                            \ td').css({ 'padding-top': '0px', 'padding-bottom': '0px'})\r\
                            \n```\r\n\r\nThe extra padding is more than half of the\
                            \ vertical width of the #pagure-issues-list table. Afterwards\
                            \ this lets me look at a reasonable set of issues in a\
                            \ not massively huge browser window without scrolling."

                          content: "In Trac, there were \"components\", and people\
                            \ filing new tickets could set up which component this\
                            \ ticket is related to, e.g. `Test Days`. In Pagure, there's\
                            \ nothing like that. There are tags, but those have to\
                            \ be assigned manually by the project owners after the\
                            \ ticket is created, the reporter can't modify them.\r\
                            \n\r\nI see 2 options how to improve this:\r\n\r\na) Allow\
                            \ reporters to assign some tags initially, when creating\
                            \ the ticket. That will allow reporters to set useful\
                            \ tags like `Test Days` (category), or `Bug`/`RFE`. It\
                            \ should be possible to pre-fill those from URL, as requested\
                            \ in #1860. This should be only possible when creating\
                            \ the ticket - after creation, only the project owners\
                            \ should have the right to change tags. Alternatively,\
                            \ this all can be configurable - there can be toggles\
                            \ in project options whether reporters can assign tags\
                            \ when creating tickets, and whether they can further\
                            \ adjust them after the ticket is created.\r\n\r\nb) Only\
                            \ allow to set tags from the URL, but not manually. This\
                            \ will allow us to create tailored hyperlinks (e.g. `Create\
                            \ a Test Day ticket` with https://pagure.io/fedora-qa/new_issue?tags=testday\
                            \ link), but it will not give the user free hands to set\
                            \ whatever they want (they still can edit the URL, so\
                            \ it's not a hard obstacle, but most people won't)."

                              always the correct behaviour, let's say. It's easy enough
                              to undo, so meh.

                            and it definitely doesn't have that group as contributors.

                              (to me) when using emojis inside of longer bodies of
                              text. If this is re-added, emojis should only "size
                              up" when they are the only thing on a new line.

                              the namespace exists and the project doesn't.

                              \ ``git commit --amend``and add to the commit message\
                              \ ``Merges https://pagure.io/fegistry/pull-request/1``\r\

                              \ if you just removed all your commits in purpose (or\
                              \ by accident) or if the branch got merged (I can't\
                              \ think of a third option right now ^_^).\r\n\r\nI am\
                              \ a little bit wondering if we should go the road of:\
                              \ if we find no commit in that PR, consider it merged.\
                              \ Will think about it :)"

                              in the workflow I described.'

                              \ an existing file with an updated one.  Or, if you\
                              \ add the wrong file by accident there should be a way\
                              \ to remove it.  Plus I don't like the idea of phantom\
                              \ files floating around in git.  If the attachment is\
                              \ not referenced, then it should be removed.\r\n\r\n\
                              This is not a critical issue though - I just wanted\
                              \ to get an Issue filed so it would not be forgotten."

                            \ be helpful to allow members outside of a repository\
                            \ to select metadata for a ticket when they file, so to\
                            \ best categorize tickets by the person filing.\r\n\r\n\
                            # Analysis\r\n\r\nThis is something I noticed would be\
                            \ helpful for Pagure repos like the CommOps, Marketing,\
                            \ Diversity, and soon-to-be FAmNA Pagures. We have a few\
                            \ tags, milestones, and priorities set up for all of the\
                            \ repositories. To tag tickets with these metadata, you\
                            \ have to be added to the repository (which doing so grants\
                            \ access to read, write, and admin access for the repo).\r\
                            \n\r\nAn option (or maybe even just defaulting to this\
                            \ behavior) for users to select metadata when filing tickets\
                            \ would be helpful in these scenarios. Then, a repository\
                            \ owner can change and edit the metadata later if it is\
                            \ incorrect. But after being created, the ticket would\
                            \ not be able to edited by anyone outside of the repository.\r\
                            \n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\n1. User files new ticket.\r\
                            \n2. User is prompted to select metadata if they have\
                            \ not selected already when filing.\r\n3. User creates\
                            \ issue.\r\n4. User is unable to edit metadata."

                            \ for any packager to approve any in-review package at\
                            \ any time.  The idea is to foster quick bits of review\
                            \ work instead of putting people on the hook for doing\
                            \ a review.  A packager can always subscribe/follow/watch\
                            \ a particular repository if they want to keep up with\
                            \ it.\r\n\r\n* How to handle abandoned reviews, since\
                            \ a repository would have an owner in a way a bugzilla\

                            \ as well.  We can't currently rename a repository; can\
                            \ we move repositories between namespaces?\r\n\r\n* Would\
                            \ really want the ability to click on a line in a source\
                            \ file and open an issue there, in the same manner as\
                            \ you can comment on a line in a patch in a PR.  I know\
                            \ you can \"fork and edit\" and then send a PR, but that's\
                            \ not what's needed here, because the idea is to point\
                            \ out issues in a spec, not to have the reviewer do all\
                            \ of that fixing.\r\n\r\n* Hook up some form of CI so\
                            \ the package is rebuilt and rpmlint/fedora-review/whatnot\
                            \ are run as things change.\r\n\r\n* Do we need dependencies\
                            \ between repositories somehow?  Would be useful in some\
                            \ sense, though one alternative would simply be to not\
                            \ open multiple reviews at once.  The CI would show them\
                            \ as not building in any case."

                              \ anyway.\r\n\r\nI know github, but your original question\
                              \ wasn't clear (just see the title, we\r\nalready have\
                              \ notifications), thus my asking.\r\n\r\nIf you're speaking\
                              \ about a notifications page grouping actions that occurred\r\
                              \nwhile you were away, like github offers, then I do\
                              \ think it's an interesting\r\nidea but I do not plan\
                              \ on working on it soon.\r\nIf someone wants it and\
                              \ wants to work on it, I'll happily review patches but\
                              \ I\r\nthink there are other priorities for pagure for\
                              \ now.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: \"Because github does it\" is\
                              \ not really the best argument for a feature\r\nrequest\r\
                              \n"

                              \n\r\nSaid script would have to exist, of course, but\
                              \ would have applicability beyond just making Exim work.\

                              That's basically what we do here, except that the piping\
                              \ happens via the milter mechanism. It should be pretty\
                              \ straight forward to adjust the script to simply take\
                              \ the email from, say stdin or so. In fact it was this\
                              \ way at the beginning iirc and then ported to be used\
                              \ as a milter which was deemed likely more reliable\
                              \ than a \"manual\" parsing."

                              \ that we'd like to use tags both for process (\"meeting\"\
                              , \"needinfo\", \"announce\") and for content (\"clarification\"\
                              , \"python\").\r\n\r\nIf we just make tags for everything,\
                              \ they all sort together unless we invent some hack\
                              \ like prefixing the process ones with \"0-\".  Being\
                              \ able to group them all would help, and would alleviate\
                              \ the need for a completely separate system for \"ticket\
                              \ status\" or something like that.\r\n\r\nBeing able\
                              \ to visually distinguish process tags from content\
                              \ tags would also be useful, but then there's a separate\
                              \ ticket for choosing the color of tags which I should\
                              \ update.\r\n\r\nI'll probably go with prefixing the\
                              \ process tags for now in hope that some other alternative\
                              \ will appear in the future.  At least we'll be able\

                              I'm not looking to have the same fork merged into two
                              different branches. Want I want is the fork being merged
                              into one branch, and same changes being made (after
                              rebase) to another branch. For the single commit case
                              this would be a cherry pick.

                            branch, on a second. It would be convenient if Pagure
                            had an easy way to create a rebased version of a pull
                            request for another branch. This doesn't provide anything
                            you can't do yourself, but it can save some time. I don't
                            know if enough people would use it to justify the development
                            work, but it would be nice to have eventually.

                              \ group\r\n- A Free-Media/Tickets repository - this\
                              \ is where the tickets will be opened (tickets will\
                              \ be private). All members of the Free-Media group will\
                              \ have write access to this, so that they can accept\
                              \ + close tickets.\r\n- A Free-Media/Housekeeping repository\
                              \ where we keep the scripts. Again, all members of the\
                              \ Free-Media group will have write access to this.\r\
                              \n\r\nAs for the API token it'll be needed for:\r\n\r\
                              \n- opening new tickets (people from outside the community\
                              \ will do this via our interface)\r\n- mass closing\
                              \ tickets\r\n- managing duplicates and the sort\r\n\r\
                              \nI guess it's OK if everyone from the Free-Media group\
                              \ has their own token - we can write some scripts to\
                              \ enable them to manage tickets via the command line.\
                              \ I don't reckon this will be an issue?\r\n\r\nAs for\
                              \ syncing the FAS group and the pagure group, how would\
                              \ one do that? That's quite important for membership\
                              \ management. Do groups have \"admins\" and \"users\"\
                              \ - I don't think so?\r\n\r\nI've started setting it\

                              \ - does this look OK? \r\n\r\n(Any chance tickets can\
                              \ be sorted using the custom fields that have been set\
                              \ up?"

                              \r\nHow would one use multiple keys (like Country and\
                              \ Year) in a report, by the way? I tried a few changes\
                              \ to the URL, but it didn't quite work."

                              \ is done by the browser, but that handle does have\
                              \ more than enough of a hit target.\r\n\r\nWhat i think\
                              \ is the issue here is that sometimes, that triangle\
                              \ hit target in your screenshot is not showing up in\
                              \ the bottom right corner. The hit target is still there\
                              \ when it isn't visible, it is just really small and\
                              \ hard to hit. \r\n\r\nI think something with the showing\
                              \ and hiding of the markdown preview is causing this,\
                              \ because if you activate the preview for a comment,\
                              \ then deactivate it, the larger hit target shows again.\
                              \ \r\n\r\n"

                              \ nonetheless. I would suggest at least to add the most\
                              \ popular ones, then for other licenses just ask for\
                              \ merge requests.\r\n\r\n> I am not entirely sure about\
                              \ the 'discourages people'.\r\n\r\nSorry my English\
                              \ is not the best  :-)    What I mean is that if there\
                              \ is a \"Select license\" field, people actually get\
                              \ to care about licensing. With no such field, it's\
                              \ almost like licensing is not important at all. I just\
                              \ think that we (people making free software) should\
                              \ encourage more this behavior of choosing a license\
                              \ for code that we share. Often on GitHub you find projects\
                              \ that the author clearly shared freely but didn't add\
                              \ any license file; the result is that every time I\
                              \ have to get in touch with the maintainer to ask under\
                              \ which license (and therefore conditions) I'm allowed\
                              \ to use his software. Besides, other development tools\
                              \ already such as autotools require users to add a license\
                              \ to their software.\r\n\r\n> What is the use case of\
                              \ this ?\r\n\r\nPractical use case: User creates a new\
                              \ repo, and the new repo is initialized with a LICENSE\
                              \ file. Other practical advantage: the LICENSE is automatically\
                              \ added for me, I don't have to go search online for\
                              \ the full text of the license.\r\n\r\nHowever it's\
                              \ not really a practical things for me, it's more about\
                              \ making developers/users aware of licensing. Other\
                              \ than this, Pagure will satisfy more of the [GNU ethical\

                              \ was looking into this the other day, and it seems\
                              \ there isn't much in the way of good Python modules\
                              \ for doing this along the lines of the [licensee](https://ben.balter.com/licensee/)\
                              \ RubyGem...\r\n\r\n[ScanCode](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit)\
                              \ only works with Python 2, and it looks kind of complex,\
                              \ so that's a non-starter. [LiD](https://source.codeaurora.org/external/qostg/lid/about/)\
                              \ looks like it might be a better option (at least it\
                              \ has Python 3 support!), but it's not clear whether\
                              \ it's independently functional yet.\r\n\r\nIf I branch\
                              \ out past Python, there's [askalono](https://crates.io/crates/askalono)\
                              \ written in Rust. It has a CLI interface as well as\
                              \ a crate module, which could be theoretically wired\
                              \ up into Python through some FFI magic (cc: @ignatenkobrain),\
                              \ but using it as a library would convert our project\
                              \ into GPLv3+ because it is ASL 2.0. But, it is an option\
                              \ as well.\r\n\r\nSo, I guess the problem here is I\
                              \ don't know what we should select for supporting detection\
                              \ and identification of licenses in a project?"

                              \ pagure didn't have namespace because of the idea that\
                              \ a project belongs to the whole community rather than\
                              \ an individual but we are now talking about private\

                              \ (you can barely call it experience) but the idea of\
                              \ approval for creating a project seems too controlling.\

                              repo into public will be a really big problem. I have
                              a small suggestion why can't we have a conf key having
                              `max_private_repo` so a specific quota of private repo
                              is given to each user. Which saves the namespace pollution
                              cause and will also be adjustable since it's a conf
                              key setting.

                              pagure is installed it doesn't get pulled in and the
                              account might not be there. I need to check if the milters
                              actually read the config file. Presumably they do or
                              it wouldn't be set up that way.

                              \ will be given an option to choose one as a \"type\"\
                              .  But there is no option to force the submitter to\
                              \ choose one, and their choice of \"type\" isn't propagated\
                              \ into any sort of tag.\r\n\r\nSo this basically splits\
                              \ into two requests (sorry):\r\n\r\n* Somehow force\
                              \ the user to choose a ticket type (i.e. disable the\
                              \ entry field if no type is chosen, or if the chosen/default\
                              \ template contains a magic string).\r\n\r\n* Automatically\
                              \ tag the issue with the ticket type, either by just\
                              \ directly using the type as the tag name, or using\
                              \ some magic string from the template."

                              \n* a template of type 'lists' could set assignee and\

                            committee's issue tracking from trac to pagure, and one
                            thing that concerns us is how a user will choose what
                            kind of issue they're filing.  It appears that users just
                            file whatever, and then after the fact someone comes along
                            and assigns tags.  It would be really great to force someone
                            to choose a category/tag/whatever before they can enter
                            an issue, even disabling the text box if possible.  It
                            would be even greater if their choice of category could
                            also choose a template.

                              documentation on Pagure, and could link to `docs.pagure.io/whatever/logo.png`.

                              \ and it seems that the \"releases\" page already allows\
                              \ uploading an unlimited number of files of any filetype\
                              \ - so really, implementing this feature would not require\
                              \ any new functionality but is more a matter of constraining\
                              \ a feature pagure already facilitates\r\n\r\nnote that\

                              be migrated sooner or later from Fedora Hosted to Pagure
                              if somehow possible. Alternatively, Fedora Infrastructure
                              would maybe have to maintain another application.

                            \ to create anonymous and private trac tickets, which\
                            \ are being handled by free media group members. The disadvantage\
                            \ with trac is, that the requester needs to use \"reply\
                            \ all\" when replying via e-mail (to update/answer the\
                            \ ticket).\r\n\r\nAt pagure it's not possible to create\
                            \ tickets without an account, neither via API nor via\
                            \ git (last of it creates an account). Given the account\
                            \ is public, this might not be what free media requesters\
                            \ are expecting on one hand, on the other hand this might\
                            \ be about 30.000+ accounts after 5+ years or so (based\
                            \ on current trac).\r\n\r\nThus the idea could be to create\
                            \ the ticket via the pagure API with a defined user, however\
                            \ with adding the e-mail address of the requester to Cc\
                            \ at this ticket - but without creating a pagure account.\
                            \ As it was pointed out, this is a potential spam scenario\
                            \ (add somebody to all tickets and the person can't do\
                            \ anything against). One idea was to make that feature\
                            \ optionally per project via admins, but there might be\
                            \ other options as well.\r\n\r\nWhile the ticket focuses\
                            \ adding e-mail addresses to Cc at tickets (without creating\
                            \ a pagure account), related ideas and suggestions are\

                              \ it better: I tried to write a Javascript application\
                              \ that would run in a browser, load data from Pagure\
                              \ and display it. When a browser makes the request,\
                              \ it needs to perform a cross-origin resource sharing\
                              \ check. It verifies that the server added HTTP headers\
                              \ that explicitly allow the resource to be used from\
                              \ another domain (in my case localhost). Since the header\
                              \ is not there, my browser would not let me make the\
                              \ request.\r\n\r\nIf you want to enable using the API\
                              \ from other origins, the server needs to add headers.\
                              \ I think this should be done in Pagure, as only the\
                              \ API should be accessible and nothing else. There is\
                              \ [an extension for Flask](http://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\
                              \ that seems to do this. I have no experience with it\
                              \ though.\r\n\r\n[More details on CORS.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS)"

                          content: In addition to OpenID it would be nice if the web
                            interface could use SAML2 authentication. It looks like
                            Ipsilon would do most of the work for this. It can also
                            use openid, so maybe it could replace the openid support
                            code while providing both openid and saml2 support.

                          content: "Currently, pull requests refer to a git repo and\
                            \ a branch and appear to \"live-update\" when the originating\
                            \ branch changes.\r\n\r\nGenerally, I find this to be\
                            \ an awesome feature! :D\r\n\r\nHowever, it does seem\
                            \ to surprise some folks, who don't seem to realize that\
                            \ changing that branch is going to affect the PR they\
                            \ submitted. Particularly when they opt to use their master\
                            \ branch.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few suggestions that may\
                            \ or may not make sense, but I think they might reduce\
                            \ some confusion.\r\n\r\n1. add an checkbox option for\
                            \ pull requests to auto-update or not (default to True/checked)\r\
                            \n2. ...except for PRs from master branch, default to\
                            \ False there\r\n3. for PRs that do not auto-update, still\
                            \ check, but instead show an alert on the PR giving the\
                            \ option to trigger the update. I think either the requester\
                            \ or project owners should be able to do this.\r\n4. possibly\
                            \ add a flag for projects that allows them to disable\
                            \ auto PR updates\r\n"

                              \ approach as you pointed out is pretty much already\
                              \ there.\r\n\r\nFor the Patch/Sign-Off approach, the\
                              \ idea has been so far:\r\n\r\n* Open a PR\r\n* Review\
                              \ the changes, update them as needed, ask the reviewee\
                              \ to squash them if desired... as a regular PR\r\n*\
                              \ Once the changes are satisfactory, download the patch\
                              \ (click on the 'Patch' button in the PR page or simple\
                              \ wget https://pagure.io/project/pull-request/id.patch)\r\
                              \n* Add sign-off-by, add a line 'Fixes https://pagure.io/project/pull-request/id),\
                              \ squash if it wasn't there, rebase if needed, commit,\
                              \ push\r\n\r\nAdding the 'Fixes...' line allows closing\
                              \ the PR as merged when pushing the commit (if the ``pagure``\
                              \ hook/plugin is enabled).\r\n\r\nSo I agree it is not\
                              \ exactly what you described, it is a bit of a mixed-model\
                              \ but I do think it gets close to what you describe.\r\
                              \n\r\nDo you think this could work for you?"

                              \ mean disabling attaching a file to issues which I\
                              \ think can be a good feature if you need to share a\

                              \ if you are the one doing the squashing at the end\
                              \ of the review, it should work.\r\n\r\nOne advantage\
                              \ (for your approach as well) of the PR page is that\
                              \ you will know before hand if the PR is conflicting\

                          content: "Pagure is designed around the Github style Fork\
                            \ / Pull Request model. Generally the outline of this\
                            \ is:\r\n\r\n* Someone wants to write a new feature, so\
                            \ they fork the repository to their own.\r\n* Do the work\r\
                            \n* commit to their fork\r\n* create a pull request\r\n\
                            * project merges.\r\n\r\nHowever, this model gets tricky\
                            \ when other things happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Someone wants\
                            \ to write a new feature, so they fork the repository\
                            \ to their own.\r\n* Do the work\r\n* commit to their\
                            \ fork\r\n* create a pull request\r\n* Pull request won't\
                            \ merge as changes have happen. Rebase and new commit\r\
                            \n* review asks for more changes to be accepted\r\n* Another\
                            \ commit happens\r\n* project merges.\r\n\r\nSo here,\
                            \ there are questions about squashing / force pushing\
                            \ the changes to make master of the project \"always clean\"\
                            . As well, it adds some other complexities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\
                            Many existing projects on fedorahosted.org are on trac,\
                            \ and use the patch / rebase workflow.\r\n\r\nThis is:\r\
                            \n\r\n* pull from master\r\n* create local branch\r\n\
                            * do work\r\n* git format-patch > send to trac\r\n* review\r\
                            \n* make more changes, squash to single commit, format-patch\
                            \ > trac for review\r\n* patch is acked, git commit --amend\
                            \ to sign off from reviewer.\r\n* rebase master to make\
                            \ sure it applies\r\n* checkout master\r\n* git cherry-pick\
                            \ commit-id\r\n\r\nThis workflow *also* has it's own issues.\
                            \ Where it does well is squashing is not as intrusive\
                            \ for branches. \r\n\r\nProjects would like to be able\
                            \ to choose their workflow. Some people prefer Pull Request.\
                            \ Some people prefer Patch Rebase. \r\n\r\nIt would be\
                            \ good for pagure to support both. This could be achieved\
                            \ by:\r\n\r\n* setting on the repository to allowing attachment\
                            \ of files to issues.\r\n* If the attachment is a patch,\
                            \ display it in the same way as a commit.\r\n* Setting\
                            \ on the repository to enable / disable forking of the\
                            \ repository.\r\n\r\nA combination of these settings would\
                            \ allow / disallow\r\n\r\n* Pull Request\r\n* Patch Rebase\r\
                            \n* Both at the same time!"

                              \ profile, and be able to upload their key, and/or specify\
                              \ a keyid to pull down from the keyserver.\r\n2. The\
                              \ key gets added to the database as \"unverified\",\
                              \ and will not yet be used.\r\n3. The user now gets\
                              \ a challenge, which could be a json string with something\
                              \ like: {\"type\": \"pagureverification\", \"host\"\
                              : \"$website\", \"user\": \"$username\"}. Concrete example:\
                              \ {\"type\": \"pagureverification\", \"host\": \"pagure.io\"\
                              , \"user\": \"puiterwijk\"}.\r\n4. We ask the user to\
                              \ run that statement through gpg --clearsign.\r\n5.\
                              \ We tell people to copy-paste the signed statement\
                              \ into Pagure.\r\n\r\nWe can now be sure that the owner\
                              \ of the key is the owner of account $username on $website\
                              \ at the moment of the GPG signature timestamp. This\
                              \ would allow us to offer this signature for other people\
                              \ to verify that we have verified the ownership of the\
                              \ key, without allowing the signature to be reused on\
                              \ other websites. This would also mean that we can always\
                              \ verify whether we actually verified the key in the\
                              \ future, so that we can be sure that an attacker (or\
                              \ admin) didn't just inject their own key into the database.\r\
                              \n\r\n\r\nKeyring:\r\nNext up would be to generate a\
                              \ keyring used to actually verify signatures on commits\
                              \ and/or tags.\r\n\r\nOne idea would be to try to verification\
                              \ with a new, temporary, keyring. Verification will\
                              \ fail, but should give us the keyid of the key that\
                              \ was used to sign. We would then look up that key in\
                              \ the database, verify it, insert it into the temporary\
                              \ keyring, and redo the verification. This is likely\
                              \ the more secure way, but will be heavy on performance.\r\
                              \n\r\nThe other idea would be to do something like SSH\
                              \ keys: we generate a keyring where we add all keys\
                              \ as soon as they are verified, with a special button\
                              \ in the admin panel to regenerate the entire keyring,\
                              \ and just use this one keyring on every verification\
                              \ attempt. This would save us some verification attempts\
                              \ (no more double verifications etc), but would mean\
                              \ the effort to keep the keyring updated is bigger.\r\
                              \n\r\n\r\nUpdating:\r\nPeople should be able to update\
                              \ their keys (add more signing subkeys etc or add revocation\
                              \ certificates) at any moment in time.\r\nWe should\
                              \ also look at running a crontab which regularly scans\
                              \ the public keyservers whether the keys are on there\
                              \ (we would NOT add them because that might impact users'\
                              \ privacy), and if it is, update the key from there\
                              \ to get new subkeys and/or revocations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\
                              Displaying:\r\nThe code in the gpg_check branch will\
                              \ verify on the releases page and on the commit view\
                              \ page whether the object is signed, and pass that to\
                              \ the templates.\r\nThe templates should then display\
                              \ the current signatory state to the user.\r\nNote that\
                              \ for commits, we must make very sure to indicate that\
                              \ this signature is ONLY for this specific commit, meaning\
                              \ that this commit is the ONLY thing that can be trusted,\
                              \ not all of its parents or children: only tags sign\
                              \ all of the entire history into the signature."

                              \ allow us to offer this signature for other people\
                              \ to verify that we have verified the ownership of the\

                              \ other websites. This would also mean that we can always\
                              \ verify whether we actually verified the key in the\
                              \ future, so that we can be sure that an attacker (or\
                              \ admin) didn't just inject their own key into the database.\r\

                              \ or admins to inject keys, since they can also inject\
                              \ the respective signature.\r\n\r\nHow so? They would\
                              \ need the private key to do so. If you leak your private\
                              \ key, then sure, admins could add it, but then so could\
                              \ anyone, anywhere...\r\n\r\n> Also I am not convinced\
                              \ why pagure would need to verify that a user owns a\
                              \ key they want to add. Btw. an easier method to verify\
                              \ ownership of keys (that contain encrypt subkeys) would\
                              \ be to encrypt a secret to the key and let the user\
                              \ decrypt it. If the secret is sent via encrypted e-mail,\
                              \ it should be a lot more convinient that creating a\
                              \  clear signature of a JSON string. Also it is not\
                              \ obvious for users why they should sign arbitrary strings.\r\
                              \n\r\nThe reason for the signing vs encrypting is mostly\
                              \ so that we can show the proof to others.\r\nIf we\
                              \ would just encrypt a string for them that they then\
                              \ have to decrypt, WE could be sure that we verified\
                              \ the keys, but we can't prove that to others, meaning\
                              \ that others will just have to trust Pagure on that.\r\
                              \n\r\n> \r\n> Keyring:\r\n> Next up would be to generate\
                              \ a keyring used to actually verify signatures on commits\
                              \ and/or tags.\r\n> One idea would be to try to verification\
                              \ with a new, temporary, keyring. Verification will\
                              \ fail, but should give us the keyid of the key that\
                              \ was used to sign. We would then look up that key in\
                              \ the database, verify it, insert it into the temporary\
                              \ keyring, and redo the verification. This is likely\
                              \ the more secure way, but will be heavy on performance.\r\
                              \n> \r\n> I do not understand why this is the most secure\
                              \ way.\r\n\r\nBecause this would prevent any cache invalidation\
                              \ errors.\r\nAs I said in my next message: \"Note that\
                              \ I'm not opposed to a general cache for performance\
                              \ reasons, but I'd suggest to make it just delete the\
                              \ entire cache as soon as any of the keys in the entire\
                              \ system change (aka, added, updated or removed), regardless\
                              \ of whether or not the key was used to sign and of\
                              \ the cached entries. This would prevent a complicated\
                              \ cache purging algorithm.\".\r\nMy main concern here\
                              \ is that cache invalidation is a hard problem, and\
                              \ I don't want to display incorrect information because\
                              \ we happened to have an error in it somewhere.\r\n\r\
                              \n> Since there is already a database with all the keys\
                              \ that are allowed to sign a commit, just put them into\
                              \ a temporary keyring and use it to verify the signature.\
                              \ If it verifies, everything is good, otherwise not.\
                              \ This also avoids using the key ID for anything, which\
                              \ should not be used at all IMHO but only fingerprints.\r\
                              \n\r\nRight, in my messages I keep mentioning the key\
                              \ id, but in my mind fingerprint == key id, since the\
                              \ key ID is just the last couple of bytes of the fingerprint\
                              \ and everyone should have abandoned the 32bit key ids\
                              \ by now.\r\nIn all my messages here, please read s/key\
                              \ id/fingerprint/. I realize it's the wrong terminology,\
                              \ but that's what I mean if I say key ID."

                              \ contain encrypt subkeys) would be to encrypt a secret\
                              \ to the key and let the user decrypt it. If the secret\
                              \ is sent via encrypted e-mail, it should be a lot more\
                              \ convinient that creating a  clear signature of a JSON\
                              \ string. Also it is not obvious for users why they\
                              \ should sign arbitrary strings.\r\n\r\nFair enough.\
                              \ So yeah, let's go with the encrypt version then.\r\

                              \ description as well:\r\n\r\nThe keyring is a sort\

                              \ source of the data (that would be the database).\r\
                              \nI was mostly talking about maintaining the keys in\
                              \ the keyring as cache invalidation.\r\nSo as said,\
                              \ if we go with a keyring that we store, we should just\
                              \ blow away the entire keyring any time any of the keys\
                              \ change, and regenerate it entirely.\r\n\r\n> \r\n\

                              \ keys that are allowed to sign a commit, just put them\
                              \ into a temporary keyring and use it to verify the\
                              \ signature. If it verifies, everything is good, otherwise\

                              and noticed this feature missing. My project has a Makefile
                              rule called "upload" that creates a signature file and
                              uploads that plus the release tarball to fedorahosted
                              using scp. It would be really nice to not have to modify
                              the workflow to use mouse clicks instead.

                              \ to use, unbloated, and above all *free software*.\
                              \ I like Pagure because it never makes me feel like\

                              \ a fad. Whenever I see these \"social logins\" I immediately\
                              \ think \"is there more? Is this website selling me?\

                              \ a service like GitHub. But if for any reason a contributor\
                              \ wants to use GitHub no matter what, I guess he can\
                              \ still develop his fork on GitHub and then ask the\

                              Most often people do not like creating yet another account,\
                              \ so having support for third-party auth would help\
                              \ on this.  3rd party in this case could be: GitHub,\
                              \ Google, Yahoo, FAS (it's an openid!), Linkedin (I\
                              \ think they do offer auth, no idea tbh), Twitter (they\
                              \ also offer auth iirc), your own local openid server,\
                              \ your own FreeIPA via kerberos  tickets.... There are\
                              \ many many options there and we could support them\
                              \ all in one go.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, pagure has\
                              \ already three types of authentication system (FAS\
                              \ via OpenID, regular OpenID and local account systems),\
                              \ so having a 'Social auth' would be just another one\
                              \ and it would be up to the admin configuring pagure\
                              \ to pick the type of auth desired.\r\nThis feature\
                              \ could be useful if we were to make an entirely public\
                              \ pagure instance, and based on your comment, maybe\
                              \ we should then consider a fifth authentication type:\
                              \ `Social+local` allowing to either logging in via a\
                              \ 3rd party or to create a local account for people\
                              \ who like you aren't trusting these type of auth.\r\

                              \ FAS, it will remain Fedora-specific :)"

                              for forks that are in sync with the primary to remain
                              in sync with the primary when the primary changes. If
                              they have changes, we can skip them. This request is
                              only asking for fast forwards when they are possible.

                              \ is more secure than an ssh key, actually. So let's\

                              \ (I know because i am part of the student body in the\
                              \ tech club of our college and have interacted with\

                              \ @jflory7, it also lowers the barrier to contribute\
                              \ for the beginners. If you see from  the beginners\
                              \ point of view, what extra efforts they need to do\
                              \ besides their academics: let's say they were taught\
                              \ python in classes, still they have to learn a web\
                              \ framework (flask here), git, the work flow pull-request/merging\
                              \ and then understand the code of the project they want\
                              \ to contribute. As i think, ssh thing may not be a\
                              \ big deal when you have  everything set up but sure\
                              \ is when you have to learn these things to get at that\
                              \ point and it's the first time you are dealing with\
                              \ it. (they teach networking in 3rd year, not that it\
                              \ should prevent them from learning about it before\

                              would make my maintainer workflow hell when not on my
                              home system, so I procastinate and do other non pagure-related
                              tasks instead.

                              \n\r\nYou've asked your employer if you can tunnel SSH\
                              \ over HTTPS?\r\n \r\n> for good security reasons, by\
                              \ people who actually looked at how ssh can be used\
                              \ to run commands from the destination to the origin\r\
                              \n\r\nSSH indeed does allow you to run commands on the\
                              \ remote host. That's one of the ways to send data to\
                              \ the remote server, and is necessary for git over ssh.\r\
                              \n\r\n> That\u2019s weaseling. It does not do x, except\
                              \ effectively it does.\r\n\r\nNo, it's a fact. You're\
                              \ not modifying the firewall rules, you're bypassing\
                              \ them by using a protocol that is allowed. You are\
                              \ legitimately making an HTTPS request, to provide a\
                              \ SSH connection.\r\n\r\n> That\u2019s the \u201Cbut\
                              \ blocking ssh is so unfair\u201D defense. It does not\
                              \ work in the real world.\r\n> Now you've got it out\

                              \ block all ports but 443 and 80. It's a really stupid\
                              \ thing to do, but I have no issues with it. It's their\
                              \ network, they can do what they like with it. It gives\
                              \ them control over the network, as they can block protocols\
                              \ they're not familiar with, such as SSH, for users\
                              \ with little or no experience.\r\n\r\nMost users I\

                            \ earlier discussion started across #fedora-commops /\
                            \ #fedora-hubs / #fedora-apps.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What\r\n\r\
                            \nThis suggestion is about adding an alternative way for\
                            \ Pagure users to commit their code to repositories other\
                            \ than SSH (e.g. using HTTPS).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\
                            \nThe issue we ran into was that there are users behind\
                            \ university and/or workplace firewalls that are unable\
                            \ to have outgoing traffic on port 22. As a result, this\
                            \ is a permanent blocker in many instances from being\
                            \ able to deploy or even use Pagure in their own personal\
                            \ infrastructure.\r\n\r\nI believe this is an important\
                            \ element to consider going forward as this alone could\
                            \ shut out contributors from also contributing to Fedora\
                            \ too. In the example of students, if a student is dependent\
                            \ on their university's network, they will be permanently\
                            \ unable to contribute to any repositories in Pagure for\
                            \ the duration of time they are in school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\
                            ## How\r\n\r\nGitHub allows for pushing code via HTTPS,\
                            \ usually with a username/password prompt or with a token.\
                            \ I'm not personally familiar with how this could be implemented,\
                            \ but it seems to be possible and possible without compromising\
                            \ security. SSH should still ideally be the default, but\
                            \ having an alternative available for those who cannot\
                            \ get around these firewall rules is important."

                          content: I was recently thinking what would it take to replace
                            Fedora's cgit and bugzilla by Pagure and I am pretty comfortable
                            with that idea, but I think that one feature is missing,
                            which is essential for Fedora/Bugzilla integration and
                            this is the possibility to reassign bug from one component
                            to other component. In case of Pagure, the equivalent
                            feature would be to reassign issue from one project to
                            another project. Is this feasible?

                              \ Copying my summary there:\r\n\r\nIn the general case,\
                              \ it would be useful for people to be able to indicate\
                              \ tickets that affect them and that they would want\
                              \ looked at sooner.\r\n\r\nAlso in special cases like\
                              \ the FESCo ticket tracker, it would be handy if we\
                              \ could vote on Change Proposals in an easily trackable\
                              \ way rather than leaving a comment like \"+1\".\r\n\
                              \r\n\r\n\r\n> I am leaning towards just having the ability\
                              \ to have a +1 to issues (not allowing the -1)\r\n>\
                              \ If someone has an issue with an issue, just allowing\
                              \ them to -1 it doenst really help, they really need\
                              \ to explain. :)\r\n\r\nWell, the secondary FESCo use\
                              \ I just described would require the -1. Basically,\
                              \ when tickets are procedural, a -1 would indicate that\
                              \ the person is opposed to the described action.\r\n\
                              \r\nIdeally, we'd also be able to set certain tickets\
                              \ (or entire repositories) as being votable only by\
                              \ the group owners of those tickets."

                              ambiguity. But I agree that it would be really helpful
                              feature to have. I see it as being more valuable to
                              groups that use tickets as a voting mechanism (e.g.
                              Council, FESCo) than as a way prioritize work on an
                              issue.'

                              \ them so they are redy to be built by a user, I do\
                              \ not mind if someone can also download a tarball made\
                              \ on the fly from a tag, but it should not be the only\
                              \ method.\r\n\r\nI could upload a release-xyz.html in\
                              \ the release area, but the fact you need admin intervention\
                              \ to correct mistakes made back out from doing that\
                              \ because in my experience it takes 2/3 edits to a release\
                              \ page before it is done.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice is\
                              \ the release area was backed by a git tree that has\
                              \ the hashes of the files uploaded automatically committed\
                              \ to it so that it is easy to see if/when a tarball\
                              \ was replaced, that way you have transparency, tracking\
                              \ and and flexibility. I think you could just reuse\

                              \ solution was to close idle connections and clean up\
                              \ the closed ones https://github.com/chfoo/wpull/issues/167\r\
                              \n\r\n------- edit\r\n\r\nThe issue is about connection\
                              \ to a server and writing files. The import point though\
                              \ is that the number of tmp files stayed constant while\
                              \ the tcp connection constantly grew. after creating\

                              \ end edit\r\n\r\n\r\nbut this doesn't seem to work\
                              \ because someone recently opened another ticket about\
                              \ this same issue. https://github.com/chfoo/wpull/issues/315\r\
                              \n\r\nAnother article suggested that its a ulimit problem\
                              \ and bump it up but when i tried that on a local machine\
                              \ it had no affect. Perhaps i need to turn off my computer\
                              \ and sync the change?? https://support.xmatters.com/hc/en-us/articles/202089439--Too-many-open-files-error-on-Linux-Unix\r\
                              \n\r\nOne thing i noticed though while testing this\
                              \ project is that my test program also failed the same\
                              \ way but if you opened the project in seperate terminals\
                              \ so seperate processes it had no problem. When i tried\
                              \ to fork the process in python i got the same results\
                              \ so it seems it needs to be independent processes.\r\
                              \n\r\nso what im thinking is that once troulius detects\
                              \ that its getting near the limit it needs to spawn\
                              \ a new parent processses that they all can interact\
                              \ with each other making sure its not spawning no proc\
                              \ for no reason.\r\n\r\nand maybe also create a maid\
                              \ function that cleans up the connections once finished/closed.\r\
                              \n\r\n------- edit\r\n\r\nforgot to mention @pingou\
                              \ the ab command was nice :) it helped and i used both\
                              \ to try to fault the program. it seems that ab will\
                              \ close its connection after a limited time so it might\
                              \ not be useful for debugging but its great to get the\

                          content: "This is a big (and half-baked) idea. While I think\
                            \ pagure is awesome, I have two big worries about it overall:\r\
                            \n\r\n1. Not getting enough momentum to attract external\
                            \ contribution and become a successful project outside\
                            \ of Fedora\r\n1. OMG we've gone and created yet another\
                            \ issue tracker for Fedora, because bugzilla, trac, mediawiki\
                            \ (!), github, jira, weren't enough :)\r\n\r\nSo, what\
                            \ if, instead of focusing on stand-alone functionality,\
                            \ pagure became a module of project-management system\
                            \ [taiga.io](https://taiga.io/)? We're experimenting with\
                            \ taiga for Fedora Rel Eng, and if that's successful,\
                            \ probably beyond that. And Taiga:\r\n\r\n* Yes, of course,\
                            \ has an issue tracking system of its own\r\n* *Does*\
                            \ appear to have some momentum (e.g. hey look Fedora is\
                            \ interested), although it's not yet huge\r\n* Has a modular\
                            \ structure \u2014 features like a scrum board, rudimentary\
                            \ wiki, the issue tracker, etc., can be enabled and disabled\r\
                            \n* already has fedauth integration :) \r\n\r\nAs I said,\
                            \ this idea is half-baked.\r\n\r\nOne possibility would\
                            \ be for pagure to remain primarily stand-alone, but to\
                            \ develop an integration module. Replacing [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/)\
                            \ (which is a kind of uber-meta-trac, if you haven't seen\
                            \ it before) seems to be a general Taiga target, and Redmine\
                            \ has a [repo viewer](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/repository)\
                            \ built in, and maybe this could be just that. I see that\
                            \ there is already github, gitlab, and bitbucket integration,\
                            \ but I don't actually know what that means yet.\r\nIdeally\
                            \ in this case the issues would be synced between the\
                            \ two systems.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to\
                            \ go all-in and integrate the pagure front-end completely\
                            \ into Taiga's. This is bigger and more invasive, but\
                            \ on the other hand makes questions like \"how to sync\
                            \ issues\" straightforward."

                              \ now automatic ACLs for protected branches, but that\
                              \ is verified by repospanner, so not pagure itself.\r\
                              \nThat automatic ACL permits SIGs (for git.centos.org)\
                              \ to have RWC rights on specific branches .\r\n\r\n\
                              But that happens at the repospanner level, so Pagure\
                              \ doesn't even know this.\r\nNow I guess your question\
                              \ is more like : what about PR against a specific branch\
